Clickatell Android Library
========================

You can see our other libraries and more documentation at the [Clickatell APIs and Libraries Project](http://clickatell.github.io/clickatell-apis/)

This is an Android Studio project.

Refer to the files for usage:

* app/src/main/java/com/schaff/clickatellsample/HttpActivity.java
* app/src/main/java/com/schaff/clickatellsample/RestActivity.java

Also remember to change your authentication details.

The library should be compatible with most version of android, I just used some views in the UI that needed a later version of Android.
